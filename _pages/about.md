Currently, I'm a Ph.D. student at Westlake University supervised by [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io). I'm working on large language models, with a focus on their applications to information extraction.

Previsouly, I worked as a research assistant at Westlake University and SUTD (Singapore University of Techlogy and Design) supervised by [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io).  I received both my MSc degree and undergraduate degree on CS from NUAA (Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics), China.

We build a Chinese Text-to-SQL dataset and start the Chinese semantic parsing and Text-to-SQL challenge: [CSpider 1.0](https://taolusi.github.io/CSpider-explorer/). Call for participation!
